Research Study Title: ${body.name}
Research Objective: ${body.objective}

Number of sessions to be generated: ${Math.min(body.number, 10)} (maximum 10 sessions supported)

⚠️ **STRICT SESSION COUNT REQUIREMENT** ⚠️:
You MUST generate EXACTLY ${Math.min(body.number, 10)} sessions - no more, no less.
- ❌ Do NOT generate ${Math.min(body.number, 10) + 1} sessions (even if you think an extra session would be helpful)
- ❌ Do NOT generate ${Math.min(body.number, 10) - 1} sessions (even if you think content can be merged)
- ✅ Generate EXACTLY ${Math.min(body.number, 10)} complete sessions
- If you generate the wrong number, the system will malfunction and the interview guide will be rejected.

Each session should follow this structure (in English):

### **Session [N]: [Session Name]**

**Session Goal:** [One clear sentence describing what this session aims to achieve]

**Section Notes:**
- **Interviewer Instructions:** Guide the interviewer on how to conduct this session, when to probe deeper (why/what/how/impact), and how to acknowledge responses naturally. Focus on building rapport and trust.
- **Background Information:** Provide 3-5 bullet points of relevant context, statistics, or domain knowledge that helps the interviewer understand this topic area.
- **Localization Reminders:** Any cultural or linguistic considerations for conducting this session effectively.

**Interview Outline:**

**[Opening]**
[A brief, warm transition statement to introduce this session topic]

Q[N].1 [Interviewer notes: [Purpose and approach for this question] [Relevant context: [Key background information]] Question: [The main question, clear and open-ended]

**Follow-up Strategy:** [If context is awkward, skip or flexibly adapt to achieve the same goal] [Specific follow-up approaches based on different user responses]
**Skip Conditions:** [When to skip follow-ups because the user has already covered the information]

Q[N].2 [Similar structure as above]
[Continue for 3-5 questions per session]

**[Transition to Next Session]**
[A smooth transition statement acknowledging what was learned and introducing the next session]

Guidelines for creating sessions:

STRUCTURE & FLOW:
- Each session should have a clear theme and 3-5 core questions
- Questions within a session should build on each other naturally
- Include specific interviewer notes, background context, and follow-up strategies for each question
- Provide natural transitions between sessions

QUESTION QUALITY:
- Ask about specific scenarios, past experiences, and real-life examples
- Use the "5 Whys" approach - dig deeper into root causes and motivations
- Explore user journeys, decision-making triggers, and emotional responses
- Keep each question concise (25 words or less) but include detailed notes for the interviewer
- Uncover user language, terminology, and mental models

INTERVIEWER GUIDANCE:
- Provide clear instructions on when and how to probe deeper
- Include background information to help the interviewer understand the domain
- Suggest natural acknowledgment phrases to avoid repetitive responses
- Specify skip conditions to keep the interview flowing naturally

SESSION PROGRESSION:
- Session 1: Usually focuses on ice-breaking, background, and building rapport
- Middle sessions: Deep dive into specific pain points, behaviors, and needs
- Final session: Explore future desires, wrap-up, and thank the participant

Use the following context to generate the sessions:
${body.context}

Additionally, generate a 50-word or less second-person description about the research study to be shown to the participant. It should be in the field 'description'. Make it clear, welcoming, and don't reveal specific details that might bias responses.

The field 'questions' should be an array where each element is a string containing the COMPLETE session text (including all the structured sections above).

Strictly output only a JSON object with the keys 'questions' (array of session strings) and 'description' (string).`;
