## Input Information

**Research Study Title**: ${body.name}

**Research Objective**: 
${body.objective}

${body.context ? `**Additional Product Documentation**:\n${body.context}\n` : ''}

**Number of Sessions**: ${Math.min(body.number, 10)} (maximum 10 sessions supported)

## Your Task

Based on the above input, generate a complete, high-quality product research interview guide.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Understand Research Needs
- Extract from \`Research Objective\`: research background, core questions, target users, expected output
- If \`Additional Product Documentation\` is provided, extract product features, positioning, user groups, and other key information
- Infer research type (new version validation / feature prioritization / future opportunity exploration)

### 2. Interview Structure Design

Typical product research session flow:
- **Session 1**: Ice-breaking + Product usage background understanding
- **Session 2**: Product experience free expression (open-ended, non-leading)
- **Session 3**: Core feature deep dive
- **Session 4**: Pain points and improvement needs collection
- **Session 5**: Competitive comparison and differentiation value exploration (if applicable)
- **Session 6**: Key review and priority confirmation

Flexibly adjust based on \`Number of Sessions\`.

### 3. Question Design Best Practices

#### Must Follow Format Standards:
- **Question ID**: \`Q[Session].[Number]\`, e.g., Q1.1, Q1.2
- **Interviewer Notes**: Include question motivation, focus points, recording points, humanized response suggestions
- **Relevant Context**: Background information directly related to this question (self-contained, no external file references)
- **Follow-up Conditions**: Each follow-up must note "If context is awkward or user has already answered, skip this follow-up"

#### Progressive Collection Strategy:
- **Single Point Inspiration**: Ask one core question first
- **Natural Extension**: Based on response, naturally ask "Anything else?"
- **Supplementary Guidance**: Gently guide to supplement missing dimensions

**Example**:
\`\`\`
Q3.1 Main Question: "While using [Product], what did you find particularly useful or satisfying?"
Follow-up 1: [If user mentions one feature] "Can you elaborate? Why does this feature satisfy you?"
Follow-up 2: [If user finishes first answer] "Are there other aspects that satisfy you?"
\`\`\`

#### Quantitative and Qualitative Balance:
- Key experience points require scoring (1-10 scale)
- After scoring, must ask "Why this score?"
- Collect specific cases and scenario descriptions

### 4. Fixed Impromptu Follow-up Instructions (Must Include in Every Session)

In each session's \`Interviewer Instructions\`, must include:

\`\`\`
If the user shares any new information relevant to our research goals, conduct 1-2 follow-up questions to understand deeply (why/what/how/impact). If irrelevant, briefly acknowledge and continue the interview. For questions with set follow-ups, skip if user has already answered in main response. When acknowledging user responses, flexibly use different expressions like 'okay,' 'I see,' 'understood,' 'that makes sense,' 'got it,' 'right,' etc., avoiding repetitive use of 'I understand.'
\`\`\`

### 5. Product Research Specific Focus

#### Feature Validation Four-Step Method:
- **Noticed**: Did user discover new features/improvements?
- **Understood**: Does user understand feature value and usage?
- **Used**: Actual usage frequency and scenarios?
- **Approved**: User satisfaction and improvement suggestions?

#### Competitive Comparison Strategy:
- Don't directly ask "Which competitors have you used"
- Instead ask "Before/while using [Product], have you used other similar tools?"
- Follow up "Compared to [Competitor], what's different about [Product]? Which do you prefer? Why?"

### 6. Inter-Session Transition Design

Each session must end with:
- Brief summary of key points user shared
- Preview of next session theme
- Request user consent to continue ("Shall we continue?" / "Ready?")

## Output Format

Strictly output in the following JSON format (do not include markdown code block markers):

\`\`\`json
{
  "questions": [
    "### **Session 1: [Session Title]**\\n\\n**Session Goal:** [What this session aims to achieve]\\n\\n**Section Notes:**\\n- **Interviewer Instructions:** [Must include fixed impromptu follow-up instructions + session-specific instructions]\\n- **Background Information:** [3-5 bullet points of relevant context]\\n- **Localization Reminders:** [Cultural or linguistic considerations]\\n\\n**Interview Outline:**\\n\\n**[Opening]**\\n[Brief warm transition statement]\\n\\nQ1.1 [Interviewer notes: [Motivation/focus/recording points/humanized response suggestions]] [Relevant context: [Key background information]] Question: [Main question content]\\n\\n**Follow-up Strategy:** [If context is awkward or user has already answered, skip or flexibly adapt] [Specific follow-up approaches]\\n**Skip Conditions:** [When to skip follow-ups]\\n\\nQ1.2 [Similar structure]\\n[Continue for 3-5 questions per session]\\n\\n**[Transition to Next Session]**\\n[Smooth transition + user confirmation question]\\n\\n---",
    "### **Session 2: [Session Title]**\\n\\n[Similar structure]..."
  ],
  "description": "50-word or less second-person description about the research study"
}
\`\`\`

## Quality Checklist

After generating the guide, self-check:
- ✅ Do all sessions cover core research questions?
- ✅ Does question design follow best practices (open-ended, progressive collection)?
- ✅ Are necessary quantitative collection items included (scoring)?
- ✅ Are inter-session transitions natural and smooth?
- ✅ Are opening and closing scripts professional and humanized?
- ✅ Is background information for each question self-contained?
- ✅ Are follow-ups marked with flexibility conditions?

---

## Important Principles

1. **Self-Contained Principle**: All background information must be directly written in the guide, cannot reference external files
2. **Flexibility Principle**: Follow-ups must note "If context is awkward or user has already answered, skip"
3. **Humanization Principle**: Avoid mechanical questioning, encourage natural conversation
4. **Efficiency Principle**: Collect most valuable information within limited time
5. **Actionability Principle**: Output insights must guide product decisions

---

Now, based on the above input information and requirements, generate a complete, high-quality product research interview guide.

**IMPORTANT**: Directly output JSON object, do not include any markdown code block markers (like \`\`\`json).`;
