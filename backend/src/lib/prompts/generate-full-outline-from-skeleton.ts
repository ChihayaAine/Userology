# Task: Generate Complete Interview Outline from Skeleton

${langInstruction}

## Research Information

**Study Objective**: ${objective}
**Research Type**: ${researchType === 'market' ? 'Market Research (New Opportunity Exploration)' : 'Product Research (Existing Product Optimization)'}
**${contextLabel}**: ${context || 'None provided'}
**Total Sessions**: ${skeleton.metadata.total_sessions}
**Estimated Duration**: ${skeleton.metadata.estimated_duration_minutes} minutes

---

## Approved Session Skeleton

The user has reviewed and approved the following session structure. Use this as the foundation for generating detailed questions:

${skeletonSummary}

---

## Your Task

For each session in the skeleton, generate:
1. **Session Opening** (Session 1 only: 6-element opening; Session 2+: brief transition)
2. **4-6 Questions** following the funnel approach (broad → specific)
3. **Follow-up Directions** (ONLY for critical questions tied to core objectives)
4. **Transition to Next Session** (natural summary + confirmation)

---

## 🔑 CRITICAL: Session 1 Opening Requirements

Session 1's opening MUST include ALL 6 elements:

1. **Warm Greeting**: Start with a friendly hello and thank the participant
2. **Interview Introduction**: Explain what the interview is about and why it matters
3. **Scope Clarification**: Briefly mention the main topics to be covered
4. **Time Setting**: Tell them how long the interview will take
5. **Expectation Setting**: Reassure them there are no right/wrong answers
6. **Readiness Check**: Ask if they're ready to begin

**Example**:
"Hello! It's great to connect with you. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our interview. Today, I'd like to chat with you about [topic]. We'll be focusing on [areas]. This interview will take about ${skeleton.metadata.estimated_duration_minutes} minutes, and I'm really interested in understanding your genuine experiences. There are no standard answers - just share what comes to mind. Are you ready to get started?"

## 📊 Question Depth and Quantity Requirements

**Each session MUST have 4-6 questions** using the funnel approach:

- **Q1**: Broad, easy-to-answer question (builds comfort)
- **Q2-3**: Explore behaviors, experiences, context (builds understanding)
- **Q4-5**: Dig into specific areas or critical topics (builds insights)
- **Q6** (if needed): Synthesize or transition

**Funnel Approach**: Start BROAD → gradually NARROW DOWN

${researchType === 'market' ? `
**Example for Session 1 (Market Research - Background Building)**:
1. Self-introduction / current role (broad, comfortable)
2. Current situation / daily context (medium specificity)
3. Relevant behaviors / practices (more specific)
4. Connection to research objective (targeted)

**Example for Session 2 (Market Research - Pain Point Discovery)**:
1. General feelings about the topic (broad)
2. Specific challenges encountered (medium)
3. Impact of those challenges (deeper)
4. Attempted solutions or workarounds (deepest)

**Example for Session 3 (Market Research - Solution Exploration)**:
1. Current tools/methods used (broad)
2. What works well (medium)
3. What doesn't work / frustrations (deeper)
4. Ideal solution characteristics (deepest)
` : `
**Example for Session 1 (Product Research - Background Building)**:
1. Self-introduction / current role (broad, comfortable)
2. Product discovery / how they started using it (medium specificity)
3. Current usage patterns (more specific)
4. Connection to their goals/needs (targeted)

**Example for Session 2 (Product Research - Feature Exploration)**:
1. Overall product experience (broad)
2. Most-used features (medium)
3. Specific feature experiences (deeper)
4. Feature impact on workflow (deepest)

**Example for Session 3 (Product Research - Pain Point Discovery)**:
1. General satisfaction (broad)
2. Specific frustrations or limitations (medium)
3. Impact of those issues (deeper)
4. Workarounds or alternatives tried (deepest)

## 🎯 Follow-up Strategy

**ONLY include follow-ups for critical questions** tied to core research objectives.

**Format**:
\`\`\`
**Follow-up Directions:**
[If user mentions X] → Probe for: [dimension 1, dimension 2, dimension 3]
[If user describes Y] → Probe for: [dimension A, dimension B]
**Skip if:** [Conditions when to skip]
\`\`\`

**Example**:
\`\`\`
**Follow-up Directions:**
[If user mentions specific exam] → Probe for: target score, reasons for choosing this exam, timeline
[If user has no exam experience] → Probe for: career goals, English learning motivation
**Skip if:** User has already explained their exam goals in detail
\`\`\`

## Output Format

Generate a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

\`\`\`json
{
  "questions": [
    "### **Session 1: [Use session_title from skeleton]**\\n\\n**Session Goal:** [Use session_goal from skeleton]\\n\\n**Section Notes:**\\n- **Interviewer Instructions:** [Session-specific guidance]\\n- **Background Information:**\\n[Use background_information from skeleton - format as bullet points]\\n\\n**Interview Outline:**\\n\\n**[Opening]**\\n[6-element opening for Session 1]\\n\\nQ1.1 [Interviewer notes: [Purpose/focus]] [Relevant context: [Key background]] \\nQuestion: [OPEN-ENDED question]\\n\\n[ONLY IF CRITICAL:]\\n**Follow-up Directions:**\\n[Directional probes]\\n**Skip if:** [Conditions]\\n\\nQ1.2 [Similar structure]\\n\\n[... 4-6 questions total]\\n\\n**[Transition to Next Session]**\\n[Natural transition + confirmation]\\n\\n---",
    "### **Session 2: [Use session_title from skeleton]**\\n\\n[Similar structure]..."
  ],
  "description": "50-word or less second-person description about the research study"
}

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

**Session 1 Opening**:
- ✅ Includes ALL 6 elements (Greeting, Introduction, Scope, Time, Expectations, Readiness)
- ✅ Warm and natural (not abrupt)
- ✅ Sets proper expectations

**Question Depth**:
- ✅ EACH session has 4-6 questions
- ✅ Questions follow funnel approach (broad → specific)
- ✅ Session 1 starts with self-introduction/background

**Question Quality**:
- ✅ ALL questions are open-ended and non-leading
- ✅ Questions focus on behaviors and experiences
- ✅ Follow-ups ONLY for critical questions
- ✅ Follow-ups are directional probes (not scripts)

**Use of Skeleton**:
- ✅ Used session_title from skeleton
- ✅ Used session_goal from skeleton
- ✅ Used background_information from skeleton (formatted as bullets)
- ✅ Generated ${skeleton.metadata.total_sessions} sessions

---

## Important Principles

1. **Use the Skeleton**: Directly use session titles, goals, and background information from the approved skeleton
2. **Open-Ended Questions**: NEVER use leading or suggestive questions
3. **Funnel Approach**: Start broad, gradually narrow down
4. **Behavioral Focus**: Ask about what people DO, not what they think
5. **Directional Follow-ups**: Provide dimensions to explore, not word-by-word scripts
6. **Natural Flow**: Each session should feel like a natural conversation

NOW, generate the complete interview outline based on the approved skeleton.

**IMPORTANT**: Directly output JSON object, do not include markdown code block markers.
