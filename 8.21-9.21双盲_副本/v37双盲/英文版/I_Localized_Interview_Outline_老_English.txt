# SparkMo v037 Existing User Interview Outline (Localized Version I - English Translation)

---
Troubles:
Response speed still slow
Follow-up depth insufficient (are section notes effective?)
AI sometimes can't hear well (thus it clarified a lot which is bothering to the interviewee)


## **Section 1: Ice Breaking & Background Understanding**

### **Section Objective:** 
Build rapport with existing users and understand their overall situation in vocabulary learning, usage habits, and SparkMo usage background.

### **Section Notes:**

#### **Host Instructions:** 
If users share any new information relevant to our research objectives, conduct 1-2 follow-up questions to gain deeper understanding (Why/What/How/What impact). If irrelevant to objectives, briefly acknowledge and continue the interview. For questions with preset follow-ups, skip the follow-up if users have already answered it in their main response. When acknowledging user responses, flexibly use different expressions like 'okay', 'mm-hmm', 'I see', 'ah I see', 'I understand', 'got it', 'yeah', 'I get it', 'right right', 'like that', etc., avoiding repetitive use of 'I understand'.

**Localization Language Reminder:** Use "APP" instead of "application", "memorizing vocabulary" instead of "memorizing words", maintaining familiar colloquial expressions for Taiwanese users.

Specific Instructions: If users mention experience with other vocabulary learning apps, briefly record but don't dig deep, focus on their SparkMo usage duration and frequency. When users pause >2 seconds, use brief acknowledgments to guide, avoid interrupting.

#### **Background Information:** 
- SparkMo is an intelligent vocabulary learning platform with core features including personalized memory algorithms, adventure map progression, and multiple practice question types
- Existing users refer to users who have used the old version and have tried the new version
- Users are mainly students with exam preparation needs or general vocabulary learning needs
- Product uses memory strength scoring system and forgetting curve algorithms to arrange review timing
- Main competitors include Duolingo, Quizlet, 百词斩, 超级单字库, Epop, etc.

### **Transcript & Follow-up Logic & Host Notes:**

Hello! Thank you very much for participating in this interview. I'm a researcher from the SparkMo team, and today I'd like to chat with you about your experience using SparkMo, especially your feelings about the new version. This interview will take about 30-40 minutes, and you can ask questions or share any thoughts at any time during the process.

First, I'd like to understand your background:

**Q1.1: Could you briefly introduce your vocabulary learning needs? For example, is it for exam preparation or daily learning?**

[Host Notes: Understand users' core motivation for vocabulary learning, which will affect their value judgment of features]

**Q1.2: How long have you been using SparkMo? About when did you start using it?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention specific usage duration over 3 months, follow up with "During this time, what was your usage frequency like? Did you use it daily or occasionally?" If usage duration is less than 1 month, skip frequency follow-up.

[Host Notes: Usage duration and frequency will affect users' sensitivity and cognitive depth regarding version changes]

**Q1.3: Before using SparkMo, have you used other vocabulary learning apps?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention specific app names, briefly ask "Why did you choose to switch to SparkMo at that time?" but don't dig deep into experience comparisons. If users say they haven't used other apps, skip follow-up.

[Host Notes: Understand users' app usage background, but focus on why they chose SparkMo, don't go deep into competitor comparisons here]

## **Section 2: General Needs & Usage Habits**

### **Section Objective:** 
Without specifically mentioning new version features, explore existing users' core needs, usage habits, and challenges encountered in vocabulary learning.

### **Section Notes:**

#### **Host Instructions:** 
If users share any new information relevant to our research objectives, conduct 1-2 follow-up questions to gain deeper understanding (Why/What/How/What impact). If irrelevant to objectives, briefly acknowledge and continue the interview. For questions with preset follow-ups, skip the follow-up if users have already answered it in their main response. When acknowledging user responses, flexibly use different expressions like 'okay', 'mm-hmm', 'I see', 'ah I see', 'I understand', 'got it', 'yeah', 'I get it', 'right right', 'like that', etc., avoiding repetitive use of 'I understand'.

**Localization Language Reminder:** Use "troubles" instead of "difficulties", "expectations" instead of "anticipations", maintaining natural expression habits of Taiwanese users.

Specific Instructions: Focus on users' "pain points" and "expectations" in vocabulary learning process. This information will be used to subsequently verify whether the new version has solved these problems. Collected pain points should be specific, avoiding abstract descriptions.

#### **Background Information:** 
- Common user pain points include poor memory effects, unreasonable review arrangements, boring learning process, inability to find suitable vocabulary books, complex operations, etc.
- Common user expectations include personalized learning plans, rich question types, clear progress feedback, interesting learning experiences, authoritative vocabulary content
- SparkMo's core value lies in intelligent memory algorithms, gamification design, diverse question types
- User scenarios are mostly fragmented time and concentrated learning time

### **Transcript & Follow-up Logic & Host Notes:**

**Q2.1: In your vocabulary learning process, what do you think is most important? Or what kind of vocabulary learning method is most effective for you?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention abstract concepts (like "effective", "interesting"), follow up with "Can you specifically describe what situations make you feel it's effective/interesting?" If user responses are already specific, skip follow-up.

[Host Notes: Understand users' definition of "good vocabulary learning experience", which is the benchmark for subsequent evaluation of new feature value]

**Q2.2: When do you usually use SparkMo and in what scenarios?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention multiple scenarios, follow up with "In these different scenarios, do you have different needs for the app?" If only single scenario mentioned, skip follow-up.

[Host Notes: Usage scenarios will affect feature needs and evaluations, such as importance of sound effects in public places]

**Q2.3: During your time using SparkMo, have you encountered any troubles or things you weren't quite satisfied with?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention specific problems, follow up with "What impact did this problem have on your learning? How did you handle it at the time?" If users say "no problems" or are very satisfied, follow up with "Is there anything you think could be improved to make it even better?"

[Host Notes: Key pain point collection question. Record specific pain point descriptions, Section 5 will systematically verify the resolution of these pain points]

**Q2.4: For vocabulary learning apps, which functions or features do you value most?**

Follow-up Logic: If users list multiple features, follow up with "Among these features, which is most important to you? Why?" If users only mention 1-2 features, skip follow-up.

**Q3.1: Have you noticed that SparkMo has been updated recently? If so, what were your feelings when you first opened the new version?**

Follow-up Logic: If users say "noticed", follow up with "What specific changes did you notice?" If users say "didn't notice" or "not sure", follow up with "Do you usually pay attention to app updates? How do you usually know when apps are updated?"

[Host Notes: Test users' sensitivity and attention to version updates, which will affect perception of new features]

**Q3.2: If you were to rate the old version of SparkMo, from 1 to 10, what score would you give? Why?**

Follow-up Logic: If users give a score, follow up with "What was this score mainly based on? Which aspects were you satisfied with, and which aspects still had room for improvement?" If users hesitate, you can prompt "You don't need to be too precise, just a general feeling is fine."

[Host Notes: 【Quantitative Collection】Record v036 rating: _points, reason: ___. Note users' rating reasons, which will affect expectations for the new version]

**Q3.3: So for this new version now, what score would you give?**

Follow-up Logic: If score differs from old version, follow up with "What's the main reason for the score change?" If score is the same, follow up with "Although the score is the same, are there any differences in usage feelings?"

[Host Notes: 【Quantitative Collection】Record v037 rating: _points, reason for change: ___. Focus on specific reasons for score changes]

**Q3.4: Overall, compared to the old version, what aspects of the new version left a particularly deep impression on you?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention specific changes or experiences, follow up with "Is this change good or not so good for you? Why?" If users say "about the same" or "no difference", follow up with "Are there any detailed changes, maybe not very obvious but you felt them?"

[Host Notes: Open exploration of version difference perception and deep impressions, don't guide users to mention specific features]

**Q3.5: During your use of the new version, have there been any experiences that didn't meet optimization expectations or were particularly poor?**

Follow-up Logic: If users mention specific features or experiences, follow up with "Can you describe the situation in detail? What impact did this have on your learning?"

[Host Notes: Capture the gap between users' expected optimization level and actual situation, reflecting the accuracy of product optimization direction]
