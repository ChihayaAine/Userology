# AI Interview Quality Issues Report - French Market Research Project

## Executive Summary

During our French market research project for English vocabulary learning apps, we identified critical issues in the Userology AI interview system that significantly impacted data collection quality. This report documents systematic question skipping and technical interruption problems that occurred across multiple interview sessions.

## Project Context

- **Research Objective**: French market needs assessment for English exam preparation vocabulary learning
- **Interview Duration**: ~30 minutes per session  
- **Target Data Collection**: 3 market pain points + 3 solution gaps + 3 SparkMo adaptability features + payment willingness data + French-English confusion error rates + feature importance evaluations
- **Interview Guide**: 6-section structured guide with 291 lines of detailed instructions

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Systematic Question Skipping

#### 1.1 Section 2 - Vocabulary Learning Pain Points (Most Critical)

**Expected vs. Actual Coverage Analysis:**

**EXPECTED (Per Interview Guide):**
- Q2.1: Spontaneous vocabulary learning associations
- Q2.2: Vocabulary importance perception  
- Q2.3: Specific learning difficulties and frustrations
- Q2.4: French-English false friends confusion (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)
- Q2.5: Quantified difficulty rating (1-10) + daily time investment

**ACTUAL EXECUTION - Anthony Interview:**
- ✅ Q2.1: Covered (Line 45: "qu'est-ce qui vous vient spontanément à l'esprit ?")
- ✅ Q2.2: Covered (Line 47: sensation/experience exploration)
- ❌ Q2.3: **COMPLETELY SKIPPED** - No exploration of specific difficulties
- ❌ Q2.4: **COMPLETELY SKIPPED** - No French-English false friends discussion
- ❌ Q2.5: **COMPLETELY SKIPPED** - No quantified difficulty rating or time investment

**ACTUAL EXECUTION - Sunshine Interview:**
- ✅ Q2.1: Covered (Line 61: "qu'est-ce qui vous vient spontanément à l'esprit ?")
- ✅ Q2.2: Covered (Line 66: vocabulary importance discussion)
- ✅ Q2.3: Partially covered (Line 73: difficulties mentioned)
- ✅ Q2.4: Covered (Line 79: false friends discussion)
- ✅ Q2.5: Covered (Line 87: 1-10 difficulty rating + 30 minutes daily)

**Impact**: Anthony interview lost 60% of Section 2 critical data, including the core French-English confusion analysis that was central to our research objectives.

#### 1.2 Section 3 - Solution Evaluation Issues

**EXPECTED**: 6 detailed questions (Q3.1-Q3.6) including tool usage, satisfaction ratings, feature preferences, and ideal app design.

**ACTUAL - Anthony Interview:**
- Section 3 abruptly ended at line 112 (995.86 timestamp)
- Q3.6 (ideal app design) was replaced with a generic question about 3 important features
- Missing: Detailed exploration of tool satisfaction, specific feature analysis, exam-focused app requirements

#### 1.3 Section 4 - Feature Validation Severely Truncated

**EXPECTED**: 5 comprehensive questions testing SparkMo feature acceptance
**ACTUAL - Anthony**: Only Q4.1 and partial Q4.2 covered before jumping to Section 5

**Evidence from Anthony Interview:**
- Line 113: Section 4 starts at 995.86
- Line 149: Section 5 starts at 1331.86 
- **Duration**: Only 5.6 minutes for entire Section 4 (should be ~7-8 minutes)
- **Missing**: Q4.3 (exam specialization), Q4.4 (French-specific features), Q4.5 (overall evaluation)

### 2. Technical Interruption Problems

#### 2.1 Session Reconnection Issues

**Anthony Interview Evidence:**
- Line 40-41: 98-second gap between Section 1 end (330.32) and Section 2 start (428.84)
- Line 41-43: "Allô, allô. Est-ce que vous m'entendez" - participant checking connection
- Line 43: Moderator confirms continuation after technical issue

**Sunshine Interview Evidence:**
- Line 18: Mid-sentence interruption with system message "Hi Sunshine, Welcome back to the session"
- Line 55-57: Multiple reconnection attempts with camera status changes
- Line 193-196: Participant reports "une fois ou deux fois quand ça essayait de recharger... on a recommencé"

#### 2.2 Audio/Connection Stability

**Participant Feedback (Sunshine):**
- "Juste une fois ou deux fois quand ça essayait de de recharger"
- "on a recommencé... plusieurs fois"
- "heureusement que... je n'ai pas dû recommencer depuis le début, ça ça a continué ou ça s'était arrêté"

### 3. Data Quality Impact Assessment

#### 3.1 Missing Critical Business Intelligence

**French-English Confusion Data:**
- **Anthony**: 0% coverage - No data on false friends, confusion rates, or error patterns
- **Sunshine**: 100% coverage - Full discussion with examples and frequency estimates
- **Business Impact**: 50% data loss on core differentiation feature

**Quantified Pain Points:**
- **Anthony**: Missing 1-10 difficulty ratings, daily time investment, specific frustration analysis
- **Sunshine**: Complete quantified data (6/10 difficulty, 30 min/day, age-related challenges)

**Feature Validation:**
- **Anthony**: Incomplete SparkMo feature testing, missing exam specialization preferences
- **Sunshine**: Truncated Section 4, minimal feature validation data

#### 3.2 Interview Completion Rates

| Section | Expected Questions | Anthony Completion | Sunshine Completion |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Section 1 | 4 questions | 100% (4/4) | 75% (3/4) |
| Section 2 | 5 questions | 40% (2/5) | 100% (5/5) |
| Section 3 | 6 questions | 83% (5/6) | 100% (6/6) |
| Section 4 | 5 questions | 40% (2/5) | 20% (1/5) |
| Section 5 | 5 questions | 100% (5/5) | 60% (3/5) |
| Section 6 | Complete section | 100% | 100% |
| **Overall** | **25 questions** | **72% (18/25)** | **76% (19/25)** |

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. AI Logic Issues
- **Time Pressure Optimization**: AI appears to prioritize interview completion over comprehensive data collection
- **Question Dependency Failures**: Follow-up questions not triggered when base questions receive partial responses
- **Section Transition Logic**: Premature section transitions without completing all required questions

### 2. Technical Infrastructure
- **Session Stability**: Frequent reconnection requirements disrupting interview flow
- **State Management**: Inconsistent recovery from technical interruptions
- **Audio Processing**: Connection quality issues affecting natural conversation flow

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Question Coverage Validation**: Implement mandatory completion checks for critical questions before section transitions
2. **Technical Stability**: Improve session persistence and reconnection handling
3. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of question completion rates during interviews

### System Improvements

1. **Adaptive Timing**: Adjust time allocation per section based on response depth rather than fixed durations
2. **Recovery Protocols**: Better state management for technical interruption recovery
3. **Quality Gates**: Implement completion thresholds for critical business intelligence questions

### Process Enhancements

1. **Pre-Interview Testing**: Technical connectivity validation before starting research interviews
2. **Interviewer Training**: AI system training on handling partial responses and ensuring comprehensive coverage
3. **Post-Interview Validation**: Automated checking of critical data point collection

## Business Impact

- **Data Reliability**: 24-28% of planned data points missing across interviews
- **Research Validity**: Inconsistent coverage of core research questions affects analysis reliability  
- **ROI Impact**: Reduced actionable insights from incomplete feature validation and pain point analysis
- **Timeline Risk**: May require additional interviews to achieve statistical significance

## Conclusion

While the Userology AI interview system demonstrates strong conversational capabilities and user satisfaction (9-10/10 ratings), systematic question skipping and technical interruptions significantly compromise research data quality. Addressing these issues is critical for reliable market research execution, particularly for specialized studies requiring comprehensive coverage of technical and cultural nuances.
